# Sprint Doc

Plan for every 4 weeks in advance, keep an day for that. 
Don't plan everything but atleast try to get a view what needs to be closed in next four weeks.

Each month is pre-named, you can change it accordingly but trust me you will know that they are correct.
Mark tick once you completed the first sprint.

# Executing the Plan
The day you start keep your first day to plan out for the week or two. 
Add the description right next to the week checkbox.
So that you know what needs to be done that week.

Create issues for everyday and add link into this sheet next to the checkbox. 
It will be easy to track.
