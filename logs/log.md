# How to create daily logs

## Todo on Day 1
> Plan your sprint.

Day 1 of every sprint is important and dedicated to planning.
Just do the following steps to plan.

* Set a Goal of what needs to be done this week. 
* If it is the starting of new month then try to plan for all 4 weeks not absolute but rough idea.
* Create issues in github for your current week.
* Add those goals and issues to the sprint file.

## Todo on other days
* create a file in the logs with the Day #number name.
* copy the template shown.
```
# Day <number> {% replace <number> with the day number %}

# Issues
> <github-issue-title> {% replace this with the issue title %}
Link: <github-issue-number> {% example #76 %}

# What you did
{% whatever you did to complete the tasks %}

# Remaining
{% in case the task was not completed, write here what remains so that you can check what is left %}
{% if nothing remains write NA here %}
{% create another issue if something remains and add it to the next sprint, not the current one unless it stops you %}
{% if it stops you from further progress, shift your sprint and do the remaining task next day %}
```
